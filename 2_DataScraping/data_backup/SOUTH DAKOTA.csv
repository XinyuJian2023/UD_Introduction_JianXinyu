CHARLES RHINES,"NOVEMBER 4, 2019",SOUTH DAKOTA,"Charles Rhines was found guilty in 1993 of murdering Donnivan Schaeffer while trying to rob the Dig ‘Em Donuts in Rapid City, South Dakota, where Schaeffer worked. In the view of his defense lawyers, Rhines is facing execution because is gay. To prosecutors, he will die because he committed an especially awful murder.
According to one state lawyer’s summary, Rhines “locked Donnivan’s head between his knees and pounded a hunting knife into the base of Donnivan’s skull, partially severing his brain stem.” After robbing the store, Rhines went to eat, and when found by police he admitted to stealing roughly $1,700, and he laughed while comparing the victim to a beheaded chicken.

RODNEY SCOTT BERGET,"OCTOBER 29, 2018",SOUTH DAKOTA,"Rodney Berget was sentenced to death for killing correctional officer Ronald ""R.J."" Johnson while attempting to escape from the South Dakota State Penitentiary in 2011.
He had been sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for a murder and kidnapping, according to court records. “I came up with a way to try to get out of the penitentiary, but I needed to get a guard's uniform,” Berget said at a hearing in which he pleaded guilty. When he saw Johnson emerge from an office, “I came as fast as I could without making any noise, and I started hitting him in the head with my pipe until he went down and he wasn't moving any longer.”",https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die/sd/s8cotqra
