He snuck into the home of 57-year-old Cecil Boren, who had been the warden at the prison years earlier and was retired. 
Williams shot Boren and took his pickup truck. He was captured in Missouri after a traffic accident, in which a delivery driver named Michael Greenwood was killed. ",https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die/ar/gms4zy2u
MARCEL WAYNE WILLIAMS,"APRIL 24, 2017",ARKANSAS,"Early one morning in 1994, 22-year-old Stacy Errickson was abducted by Marcel Williams from a gas station in Jacksonville, Ark., near Little Rock.

Nine days later, he was arrested on an outstanding warrant for a separate crime, and he confessed to the kidnapping but said Errickson was still alive. Her body was later found buried in a shallow grave. 
He was sentenced to death in 1997. On appeal, Williams’s defenders found that his trial lawyers had failed to discover that their client had suffered from abuse throughout his life. As a child and into his teenage years, he was pimped out by his mother in exchange for food and lodging. She also beat him with extension cords she had boiled. He was gang-raped while serving time in an adult prison. ",https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die/ar/dzu5ax16

Lacy Phillips, the victim’s 9-year-old daughter, testified at trial that a man who matched Jones’s description had entered the accounting business where her mother worked, forced the two of them to lie down, and took cash from a register. She said that he choked her until she passed out and hit her with a gun. She woke up as police were investigating the crime scene, where her mother had been found, strangled and bludgeoned. Using the girl’s description of the suspect, police found Jones, and he confessed to the murder.",https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die/ar/bk9s29hx
LEDELL LEE,"APRIL 20, 2017",ARKANSAS,"Even among death penalty cases, which are known for their complexity, the case of Ledell Lee stands out. He was sentenced to death for the 1993 fatal bludgeoning of 26-year-old Debra Reese, having previously been convicted of two separate rapes in the Jacksonville, Ark., area. He was later accused of the strangulation murder of 22-year-old Christine Lewis in 1989, but a jury deadlocked, and prosecutors decided not to retry him after his death sentence for Reese’s murder.
In the lead-up to trial, Lee argued that his attorneys had a conflict of interest, because they had been appointed to defend him in other cases and might need to use defense strategies that would work at cross purposes. Lee sued his own lawyers in order to strengthen this conflict of interest claim, but Judge Chris Piazza (who earlier in his career prosecuted some of the men up for execution this month) ruled there was no conflict of interest. A jury deadlocked 11-1 on whether Lee was guilty of Reese’s murder, but it was later discovered that the holdout juror had been represented by one of Lee’s attorneys.",https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die/ar/so910u31

DUSTIN JOHN HIGGS,"JANUARY 16, 2021",FEDERAL PRISON,"In January 1996, Dustin Higgs participated in the kidnapping and murder of three woman: Tamika Black, Mishann Chinn and Tanji Jackson. According to federal prosecutors, after Jackson rebuffed a sexual advance from Higgs at his Maryland apartment, he and two friends offered the women a ride home. They instead drove them to the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge. Prosecutors say around 4 a.m., Higgs ordered his friend Willis Haynes to shoot the women—and “make sure they’re all dead.” Haynes killed all three women, who ranged between the ages of 19 and 23.
Prosecutors learned that Higgs had threatened other women with a handgun and participated in one drive-by shooting. The case could be tried in federal court because the crime took place on federal land, and jurors technically gave Higgs nine death sentences. “It won't bring our children back, but we are relieved that justice was served,” Krishana Chinn, the mother of one victim, told a reporter after the trial. Higgs was the first person from Maryland to be sentenced to death in federal court. Tamika Black’s mother, Joyce Gaston, agreed: “He ordered my daughter's death, and I think it's only appropriate that his death is ordered.”",https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die/fe/4d925re1

Former Virginia gang member Corey Johnson was originally sentenced to die for seven murders in the early 1990s.

ALFRED BOURGEOIS,"DECEMBER 11, 2020",FEDERAL PRISON,"Alfred Bourgeois was sentenced to death in 2004 for the murder of his 2-year-old daughter. Since then, the legal battle over whether he can be executed has turned on the extent of his intellectual disability. Congress and the Supreme Court have both forbidden the execution of someone with such a disability, but state and federal courts have continually debated how precisely to determine whether someone has one.
Bourgeois was a long-haul truck driver, originally from Louisiana. In 2002, a paternity test showed that he was the father of a toddler. Bourgeois made arrangements with the girl’s mother to take her on his trucking route for a summer. According to prosecutors, over the course of a month Bourgeois punched, whipped and burned his daughter, forcing her to sit for hours on a toilet training chair. While he was delivering goods along with his wife at the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station, she tipped over the chair, and he slammed her head into the truck’s window and dashboard. A medical examiner said in court that her cause of death was “an impact to the head resulting in a devastating brain injury,” but that she had already suffered from numerous other injuries.",https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die/fe/4pyw4sgm
